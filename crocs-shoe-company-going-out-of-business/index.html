<p>Crocs are a bit like marmite, in that many people would sooner stick their feet in jars of spoiled yeast than in a croc. Still, the company asserted that it was not going out of business. The company has since established a considerable following with american middle school and high school students, with many opting for crocs to use as school shoes for the school day. But despite being objectively visually unappealing, the shoe brand still became popular for being cheap, comfortable, and easy to clean, making it a longtime favorite among parents who figured their kids would�ve gotten bullied anyway.
