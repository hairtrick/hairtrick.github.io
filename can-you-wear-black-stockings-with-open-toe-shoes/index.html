<p>Thanks for the reply kitty t and puzzicato, i totally agree with you both, it is weird to wear black stockings with a mainly nude shoe, it�s just that they are the kind of shoe i would have worn with trousers before or not worn with stockings at all, as i only ever wore black or brown tights before during the day, with the relevant shoes. To achieve this look, you can wear a black sheath dress with nude open toe heels and a ivory bag. To build a stylish outfit around it, you can wear a black maxi pleated skirt with a brown leather belt. I go to many professional events and unfortunately some do involve supporting my husband as he represents his company at a funeral where i do not know the deceased or family. Open Toes and Hosiery Should You or Shouldn�t You.</p>

<p>Basically, nude heels are often worn to enhance this optical illusion. Exceptions would be colored sheers, such as sheer black hose / stockings or tights. Whether you prefer them rendered in suede, patent, or leather, booties are the perfect shoes to wear with tights during the winter.
