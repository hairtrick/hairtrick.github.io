<p>Bowerman, one of nike’s founders, was one of the greatest innovators of his generation in regards to shoe ingenuity and design. The reason for this is that bill was constantly tinkering and modifying his shoes, and bowerman added the waffles and a strip of white material to the right shoe for mays to test (as discussed in the accompanying letter), which he never got around to. Bowerman and knight’s story of turning a passion and simple idea into a successful business exemplifies what it means to be an entrepreneur. Learn about the history of nike’s waffle shoes here.
