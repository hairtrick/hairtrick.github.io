<p><strong>Climbing Shoe Hot Spots</strong>, Climbing shoes are a specially made shoe that fits around the climber’s toes tightly to help climbers use small footholds or the edges of cliffs/climbing walls for toe hooks and heel hooks. Before deciding against a climbing shoe because of a hot spot, make sure you have to climbing shoe on properly. Wearing your shoes inside is common practice for breaking in new hiking boots or sneakers although, unlike sneakers, i don’t recommend walking around too much in your climbing shoes.
