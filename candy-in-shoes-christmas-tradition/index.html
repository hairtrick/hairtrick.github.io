<p>Nicholas day or nikolaus sometimes also spelled nikolas is the patron saint of children and on december 6th children throughout germany wake up to find small gifts and goodies in their shoes. The mexican celebration of christmas is called las posadas and begins on december 16. Why we should bring back the tradition of the christmas orange. Then when father christmas comes around on the 24th, he actually tells the kids how their doing — you’re getting better at hand washing peter, but you need to work on your math! Happy Saint Nicholas Day! to Germerica.</p>
