<p>If you purchase a sneaker, you can wear it in a bigger size, but you should only wear it up to half a size. I�ve bought them and tried to make them work, but i never end up wearing them. If you�ve experienced foot pain, corns or callouses, foot deformities, or you aren�t feeling as steady on your feet as usual, you may want to get your shoe size measured. I would advise against it. Big Shoes to Fill Actuele opdrachten.</p>
